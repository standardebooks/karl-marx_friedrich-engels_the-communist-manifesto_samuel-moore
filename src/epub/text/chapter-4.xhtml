				<p epub:type="title">Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Existing Opposition Parties</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p><a href="chapter-2.xhtml">Section <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span></a> has made clear the relations of the Communists to the existing working class parties, such as the Chartists in England and the Agrarian Reformers in America.</p>
			<p>The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future of that movement. In France the Communists ally themselves with the Social-Democrats,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a> against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the right to take up a critical position in regard to phrases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution.</p>
			<p>In Switzerland they support the Radicals, without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeois.</p>
			<p>In Poland they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution, as the prime condition for national emancipation, that party which fomented the insurrection of Krakow in 1846.</p>
			<p>In Germany they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way against the absolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
			<p>But they never cease, for a single instant, to instil into the working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the German workers may straightway use, as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the social and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy, and in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in Germany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin.</p>
			<p>The Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of European civilization, and with a much more developed proletariat, than that of England was in the seventeenth, and of France in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution.</p>
			<p>In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.</p>
			<p>In all these movements they bring, to the front, as the leading question in each, the property question, no matter what its degree of development at the time.</p>
			<p>Finally, they labor everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries.</p>
			<p>The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.</p>
			<p>Workingmen of all countries unite!</p>
